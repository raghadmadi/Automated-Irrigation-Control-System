# Automated Irrigation Control System

An automated irrigation control system designed to optimize water usage by integrating sensor-based logic.  
The system detects rainfall conditions and automatically adjusts irrigation behavior to improve efficiency and reduce water waste.

This project was developed and tested using **MPLAB** and **Proteus** as part of an embedded systems application.

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automate irrigation based on environmental conditions.  
By monitoring rainfall status through sensors, the system decides whether irrigation should be activated or stopped.

This approach ensures:
- Efficient water usage
- Reduced manual intervention
- Smarter environmental response

##  Technologies & Tools Used

- Embedded C
- MPLAB IDE
- Proteus Simulation Software
- Microcontroller-based design
- Sensor-based decision logic

---

##  System Functionality

- Detects rainfall conditions using sensor input
- Automatically enables or disables irrigation
- Prevents irrigation during rainfall
- Operates without human intervention
- Designed for efficiency and reliability

---

##  System Logic

1. Read sensor input (rain detection)
2. Analyze environmental condition
3. If rainfall is detected:
   - Irrigation is turned **OFF**
4. If no rainfall is detected:
   - Irrigation is turned **ON**
5. Continuously monitor and update system state

##  Simulation & Testing

- The system was fully simulated using **Proteus**
- Program logic was implemented and tested using **MPLAB**
- Multiple scenarios were tested to validate correct behavior under different conditions
